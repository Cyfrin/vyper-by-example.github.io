Events write logs to the blockchain, commonly used by application to monitor blockchain state and as a cheaper alternative to store data on the blockchain without using state variables.

Events can be efficiently searched by indexing their arguments. Up to 3 parameters can be indexed.

```vyper
{{{Event}}}
```
